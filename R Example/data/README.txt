**Wetland habitat 
We used The Natural England Priority Habitat Inventory V3.0 (https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/Defra::priority-habitats-inventory-england/about) to define the Wetland habitat networks, through coarsening the habitat categories and rasterising. All the analysis and post-processing steps are described in the User Guide [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10477236&version=1.0].

**East region
The East region is one of the eight regions defined for England for finer-resolution analysis, based on sets of Local Nature Recovery Strategies areas (LNRS areas; https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/89129374-303f-4df6-b5c4-a9a11486be64). 
**Dispersal distance
The 2 km dispersal distance for regional analyses is based on a large set of UK species. This represents a median distance based on the literature assembled by Travers (2022; https://doi.org/10.17638/03166287).
 
**Sources and targets 
The sources and targets setting the directions for speciesâ€™ movement were derived from 2 km buffers around the LNRS areas, using a combination of ArcGIS Pro tools and manual selection. To split these buffers into strips we also used polygons of Scotland and Wales from the  OS Open Boundary Line data set (https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/84abd3c7-c9fc-4faa-a3c3-b3e0dc79c718/boundary-line). 

Further details for anyone wishing to understand and use the data can be found in the User Guide Document available here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10477236.
